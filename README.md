### This repository contains small todolist project to understand react-query

```
This project helps you understand fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state using react-query. While most traditional state management libraries are great for working with client state, they are not so great at working with async or server state and for that we can easily use react-query as it works amazingly well out-of-the-box, with zero-config, and can be customized to our liking as our application grows.
